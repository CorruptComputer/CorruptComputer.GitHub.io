        <p>I am currently a college student at Angelo State University, studying Computer Science. I started programming in high school, and had a great teacher. My first language was Java and I will always remember my first <code>Hello world!</code>
          It has inspired me to learn everything I can about programming and I have realized that computers are only limited to the knowledge and skill of the developer, there's almost no end to what is possible!

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/CorruptComputer/Officer-Beepsky">Officer-Beepsky</a>:</h3>
        <p>Officer-Beepsky is an open source Discord bot. I made it for some friends and me to use in order to play music and manage our server. It is built with <a href="https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J">Discord4J</a> as its main API to use to
          connect to Discord.

        <h3><a href="https://tgstation13.org/wiki/AsteroidStation">/tg/ Station 13: Asteroid Station</a>:</h3>
        <p>Asteroid Station was a collaborative effort between myself and <a href="https://github.com/Jordie0608">Jordie0608</a>. It was an ambitious project, a large space station set inside of an Asteroid, and it was fairly popular during its lifetime,
          however was never completely finished and now with the codebase moving on without it, it sadly is no longer maintained.
