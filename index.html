      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    </header>
    <p>I'm currently a student at Angelo State University, studying Computer Science.
      I started programming in high school, and had a great teacher.
      My first language was Java and I will always remember my first <code>Hello world!</code>, ever since I have been trying to learn everything I can about programming.
      I have become fascinated by the fact that computers are only limited to the knowledge and skill of the developer, there's almost no end to what is possible.
