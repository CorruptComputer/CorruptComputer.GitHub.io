   <h2>Hello!</h2><hr />
   <p>
      I started programming in high school, and had a great teacher. 
      My first language was Java and I will always remember my first <code>Hello world</code>. 
      Ever since then I have been trying to learn everything I can about programming. 
      The greatest aspect of computer programming to me is the endless possibility and the control that comes with writing software.
      The amount of knowledge and skill is limited only to the will of the programmer and there is always something new to learn and improve!
      <br />Below you will find some more information about me and what I am currently doing:

            <p>
                Asteroid Station was a collaborative effort between myself and Jordie0608. 
                It was an ambitious project, a large space station set inside of an Asteroid, and it was fairly popular during its lifetime. 
                Sadly however was never completely finished and now with the codebase moving on without it, it sadly is no longer maintained.
