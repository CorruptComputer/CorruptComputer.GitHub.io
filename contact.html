       <h4>Discord: CorruptComputer#0001</h4>
       <p>I use Discord a lot, and this is sometimes the fastest way to get in contact with me.
       </p><hr />

       <h4>Email: <a href="mailto:nickolas@gupton.xyz">nickolas@gupton.xyz</a></h4>
       <p>If you'd prefer, you can send me an email as well. This is a more guaranteed way to get in contact with me, as I will always see a notification as soon as I recieve it.
       </p><hr />

       <h4>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickolasgupton/">Nickolas Gupton</a></h4>
       <p>This should give you some more info about me if you're looking for business reasons or just want to see more about where I work.
       </p><hr />

       <h4>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/CorruptComputer">CorruptComputer</a></h4>
       <p>Not really a way to contact me unless you want to just open an issue on a project of mine. But you can see what I have been working on here.
