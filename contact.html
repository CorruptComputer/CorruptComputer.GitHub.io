       <h4>Discord: CorruptComputer#0001</h4>
       <p>
           I use Discord a lot, and this is sometimes the fastest way to get in contact with me.

       <h4>Email: <a href="mailto:nickolas@gupton.xyz" target="_blank">nickolas@gupton.xyz</a></h4>
       <p>
           If you'd prefer, you can send me an email as well. This is a more guaranteed way to get in contact with me, as I will always see a notification as soon as I receive it.

       <h4>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/CorruptComputer" target="_blank">@CorruptComputer</a></h4>

           I share stuff I think is really awesome on Twitter. Follow me if you want to keep up to date with what I'm doing!

           This should give you some more info about me if you're looking for business reasons or just want to see more about where I work.

       <p>
           Not really a way to contact me unless you want to just open an issue on a project of mine. But you can see what I have been working on here.
