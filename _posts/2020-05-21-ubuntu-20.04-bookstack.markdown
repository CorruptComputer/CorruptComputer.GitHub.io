[BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/) is a free and open source Wiki software. Its powerful markdown editor and ease of use has made it a popular alternative to software such as [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/DokuWiki) and [Wiki.js](https://wiki.js.org/). It is also very easy to setup and get running. In this article I will show you how to install and configure BookStack to work on Ubuntu Server 20.04 with an SSL certificate from LetsEncrypt.

The first thing you need to do is install Ubuntu Server 20.04 on any platform of your choice. Personally I use [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), however any provider or even self-hosting would work just fine for this.

Once that is complete we can move onto installing BookStack itself, this is very easy and these instructions are [directly from their Wiki](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/installation/#ubuntu-2004).

Enter your domain name that the server will be hosted at when prompted.

Once that completes you should be able to access BookStack in the browser. With the default username being admin@admin.com and password being password, these should be changed, but first lets setup SSL to make secure.

First thing to do is install certbot and get the certificate generated.

Once that is done we can configure Apache to use the certificate for Bookstack.

This is what the file should look like before: <script src="https://gist.github.com/CorruptComputer/31290e6174dd5d0f497b37f802c46987.js"></script>

This is after making the required changes: (the only changes required happen above line 10) <script src="https://gist.github.com/CorruptComputer/10724d22cc8b9b8be2ee4830a38016b1.js"></script>

Finally you need to enable SSL on Apache2 and restart the service: <script src="https://gist.github.com/CorruptComputer/36ece391cb4ab83767971bae4b1059ee.js"></script>

Aaaaaaaand just like that you're done! Its a fairly simple setup, and below you can find some extra steps for afterwards to help keep it secure.

1. Change the admin users password and email address.
2. [Setup SMTP](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/email-config/) for password resets.
3. Add `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true` to `/var/www/bookstack/.env` so cookies are only delivered over SSL.
4. Setup UFW to block SSH from un-trusted IP addresses.
5. Setup fail2ban to block brute force attacks from logging into your server.
