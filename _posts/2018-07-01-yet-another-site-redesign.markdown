I have decided to (yet again) give my site a quick remodel. This time it took less than 24 hours from start to finish, and as I did last time: I started from scratch. I started last night at around 8pm after watching a [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVnQN-wTeks) which was discussing web design. This new site (In my opinion) looks waaaaay better than my first attempt, and as an added bonus: it doesn't use JavaScript. I also made this by designing for mobile first, as the one before was a pain to use on mobile.

The code is all available on [GitHub](https://github.com/CorruptComputer/CorruptComputer.GitHub.io) if anyone wants to take a peek. There are some tweaks that probably still need to be made, but for now I think everything looks alright. If you have any feedback just open an issue and I'll definitely take a look!

Also in my last blog post I said that I was wanting to post at least once a month, and seeing as that was 5 months ago... I didn't hit that goal, and I would like to apologize for that. You see, I have actually gotten a new job, which is now taking most of my time. I may write a post about the job I have now sometime in the future.
