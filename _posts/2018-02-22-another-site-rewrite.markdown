I decided it was about time for me to write my own site from scratch. I have had a website for awhile now, and done some basic things with HTML/CSS/JS, but this is the first time I've written a full site from scratch. I was used to mostly using what was already available, or being given a template. Not anymore!

This took me awhile mostly because I changed frameworks twice, going from React/jQuery, to Bootstrap/jQuery, and finally to just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. But the end result is great! It might not look the most professional, but it has (what I think) a unique style which reflects my own. And really if the site is about me, shouldn't it feel like it has my personality? 

The code is all available [here](https://github.com/CorruptComputer/CorruptComputer.GitHub.io) for if anyone wants to take a peek. There are some tweaks that probably still need to be made, but for now I think everything looks alright. If you have any feedback just open an issue on GitHub and I'll definitely take a look!

I'm going to make an effort in 2018 to try to write at least one post per month. I said I was going to be active last time a re-wrote the site, and I was for a couple months. But now I have things planned out that I am going to be writing, so expect more soon!
